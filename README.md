LookML files for a Facebook block compatible with Pipeline's schema

**Tables from the Facebook integration include your unique account id.** To use this block, you will need to:

1. Replace the `_101441173373823` in each view file with your own account id.
2. Ensure any hashed column names included in this block (i.e., spend#xxxxxxx) are replaced with the appropriate column from your schema.
